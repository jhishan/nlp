I was able to accurately compute the tfidf tables for both the queries list and the abstract list. 
Unfortunetly, I was not able to properly compute the cosine similarities. My accuracy was .05 percent which was pretty low. I may have made a mistake in the way I was building my arrays but I'm not quite sure. 

To run my program, type in python similarity.py
The output file is called output.txt and is placed in the file you run my program in. 

Please let me know if you have questions about my code.
